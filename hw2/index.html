<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    Section 1 of this homework revolved around implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for Bezier curves and Bezier surfaces. I found these parts pretty straightforward after understanding the algorithms as descrbied in lecture. I fixed most of my unexpected outputs by setting breakpoints and stepping through my code.
<br><br>
    In Section 2, I implemented operations on meshes including edge flips and edge splits. I found drawing out all the instances of each mesh component to be very helpful in meticulously assigning properties in the code.

</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    Given a vector of $n$ control points, de Casteljau's algorithm recursively assigns $n-1$ new "control points" as interpolations of the previous vector until there is only one resulting interpolated value. This final value is a single point on the actual Bézier curve. The interpolation coefficient $t$ ranges from 0 to 1. In $\texttt{evaluate_step()}$, I allocate a vector and append at position $i$ the linearly-interpolated value between positions $i$ and $i+1$ from the input vector.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.
</b>
<br><br>

<b>
  Show screenshots of each step / level of the evaluation from the original control points down to the final evaluated point. Press <kbd>E</kbd> to step through. Toggle <kbd>C</kbd> to show the completed Bezier curve as well.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    For Bézier surfaces, de Casteljau is evaluated over control points that came from 1D evaluations along one dimension of the surface. I implemented it by calling $\texttt{evaluate1D()}$ for each row of the surface separately, then calling a final $\texttt{evaluate1D()}$ over the collection of those outputs. $\texttt{evaluate1D()}$ itself is implemented as an iterative $\texttt{evaluateStep()}$ until only one point (a point on the resulting curve) remains.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by iterating through triangles around a vertex (as shown in the primer), finding the position of the three triangle vertices, and performing the cross product between two vectors intersecting the vertices to get an area-weighted normal. Then, these normals are summed up and normalized to get the final area-weighted vertex normal.</p>

<b>
    Following the diagram above, I assigned halfedges $0-9$, vertices $0-3$, edges $1-4$, and faces $0-1$. Then, I re-assigned the next, twin, vertex, edge, and face properties of each halfedge according to the drawing. Finally, I re-assigned the proper halfedges for the vertices, edges, and faces. I ran into infinite looping problems, but solved them by returning e0 instead of re-assigning e0 at the end of the loop.</b>

        Following the diagram above, I assigned halfedges $0-9$, vertices $0-3$, edges $1-4$, and faces $0-1$. Then, I allocated 6 new halfedges, 1 new vertex (with position halfway between v2 and v3), 3 new edges, and 2 new faces. Then, I re-assigned the next, twin, vertex, edge, and face properties of each halfedge according to the drawing. Finally, I re-assigned the proper halfedges for the vertices, edges, and faces. I initially forgot to set the position and had to debug why my new vertex was not showing up, but besides that did not run into debugging issues.    <br><br>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented Loop subdivision following the recommended steps:
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh, marking them as part of the old mesh along the way.</li>
        <li>Compute the updated vertex positions associated with edges (using the fractional formula).</li>
        <li>Split every edge in the old mesh, storing new/old information along the way.</li>
        <li>Flip edges that connect an old and new vertex.</li>
        <li>Copy new vertex positions into the position property.</li>
    </ol>
    I mainly needed to debug the centroid calculation in step 1, but using a visual debugger helped me figure out how to fix my assignments.

    <br>
    <br>

</div>
<br>
Below is an example of a mesh visibly changing in geometry due to pre-split edges. Usually, sharp edges are totally smoothed out after enough upsampling, but we can introduce more deformities by splitting and flipping early on.
<br><br>
<div align="middle">
    <img src="24/245.png" align="middle" width="24%">

    <br>
    <br>
    Left, right: icosahedron before and after Loop upsampling. Center: icosahedron with some pre-split edges after Loop upsampling; the geometry visibly changes.
</div>
<br>
The figure below shows that the edges of $\texttt{dae/cube.dae}$ can be split so that the upsampled mesh is symmetric. To do this, the single edge is split into 4 edges for all cube faces.
